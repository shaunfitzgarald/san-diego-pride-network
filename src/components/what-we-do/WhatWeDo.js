        <h1>Our Commitment to the Community</h1>
        <p>
          At San Diego Pride Network, our mission transcends beyond celebration. As a beacon of philanthropy, 
          our nonprofit works tirelessly to foster an environment of inclusivity, equity, and unity. We channel funds 
          to support and empower LGBTQ+ programs, focusing on marginalized groups within our vibrant tapestry - the youth, 
          people of color, transgender individuals, those living with HIV/AIDS, seniors, and more.
        </p>
        {/* <h2>Our Funding Focus</h2>
        <p>
          We direct our support to projects and organizations that align with our vision of justice and equality, 
          that endeavor to dismantle complex challenges faced at the intersectionality of various marginalized identities.
          Our commitment is towards actions, not just words, with funding directed to tangible programs that make a 
          significant impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          While our hearts are big, there are areas we do not fund, such as individual financial support, political campaigns, 
          and initiatives with budgets over $1 million, to name a few. This ensures that our contributions are impactful where 
          they're most needed.
        </p>
        <h2>Eligibility for Funding</h2>
        <p>
          If your organization serves the LGBTQ+ community, provides direct services or programs in line with Pride's mission, 
          and holds a 501(c)(3) status, we encourage you to apply. Our Community Grants application window reopens in October 2024.
        </p>
